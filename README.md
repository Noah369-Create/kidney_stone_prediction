## End-to-End User Interface Based ML Project for Predicting Kidney Stone Existence
This project aims to predict the possible existence of kidney stones using a lab report dataset. It features an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, starting from data preprocessing to the deployment of a user-friendly interface for prediction. The project integrates essential data science activities such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, all wrapped in a web-based interface to enhance user interaction.
## Project Overview
# Goal
The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of kidney stones based on several lab test results. The prediction model is embedded within a web-based user interface that allows healthcare professionals and patients to input lab values and get instant predictions.
### Key Features:
User Interface: A clean, responsive, and intuitive web interface that allows users to input lab values and receive predictions.
Data Science Pipeline: Complete data science workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, transformation, and model training.
Model Evaluation: Training 10 different machine learning models and selecting the best performing one based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
